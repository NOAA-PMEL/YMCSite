	<h1>Atmospheric Radiation Measurement-Diurnal Cycle Interactions with Madden-Julian
Oscillation Propagation (ARM-DIMOP) </h1>
		<h2>Contact point:</h2>
		<p>Samson Hagos (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)</p>
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>In this campaign, we plan to investigate radiative and turbulent flux processes before, during
and after the passage of MJO episodes with the aim at explaining why some events of the MJO
successfully cross the MC while others do not. Specifically we will explore the mechanism that
controls the strength of the diurnal cycle over the MC. We hypothesize that land surface
conditions (ground moisture) and cloudiness (deep clouds) ahead of MJO convection centers
modulate the diurnal cycle in land convection and hence subsequent MJO propagation across the
MC. Paired with operational ground radar, satellite observations and measurements from the
broader International YMC field observations, the surface-based data collected by our
deployment of US Department of Energyâ€™s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program
instruments will help quantify the comparative roles of these and possibly other processes key to
the barrier effect of the MC on MJO propagation. The field campaign will collect measurements
of precipitation, soil moisture, surface radiation and turbulent fluxes for a one-year period. As the
first step in testing the proposed hypothesis, MJO events during the observation year will be
grouped into propagating and disrupted based on whether they successfully cross the MC. We
will use the collected observations to make composite diurnal cycles of the various variables for
the two types of MJO events to examine their possibly distinct features during all the phases of
the MJO events. The surface flux and soil moisture measurements will be used to identify those
features. The second task is to extend the analysis to about 50 MJO events initiated over the
Indian Ocean during the TRMM era by examining the relationship between the one-year-long
point measurements of surface radiation with (i) areal mean precipitation (~220 km diameter)
estimated from the BMKG C-Band radar, (ii) TRMM precipitation, and (iii) geostationary
satellite infrared brightness temperature measurements. A correlation of the point measurement
with these spatial and long-term measurements would allow us to generalize the findings from
the first step via satellite proxies to a large number of MJO episodes. </p>
