Reading, NERC PI), Karen Heywood (University of Reading, NERC co-PI) </p>
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>In this project, the interactions within atmospheric equatorial convectively coupled Kelvin
waves (CCKWs), the leading modes of eastward moving convection on time scales between
several days and three weeks, will be investigated. CCKWs and other equatorial waves form the
“building blocks” of the active phase of MJO. The main effort will be to organize and execute the
Equatorial Line Observations (ELO) field campaign during the winter of 2018/2019 – as a
component of the International Years of the Maritime Continent (YMC) program. Based on
collected in-situ data as well as other observational, remote sensing and modeling datasets, the
key physical mechanisms responsible for multi-scale interactions associated with the propagating
atmospheric convection over the Maritime Continent will be analyzed. </p>
