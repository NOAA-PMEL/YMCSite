		<h1>Ocean Mixing</h1>
		<h2>Contact point:</h2><p>Toshiyuki Hibiya (The University of Tokyo) </p>
		<h2>Overview:</h2><p>To clarify the distribution and magnitude of tidal mixing in the Indonesian Seas, we plan to carry
out direct microstructure measurements throughout the deep ocean mainly in the mixing hotspots
predicted by three-dimensional numerical simulations. In order to identify the key region for the
water-mass transformation, we also conduct CTD/LADCP measurements to clarify the physical
processes for the transformation of the ITF water. </p>
		<h2>Objectives:</h2><p>Study on turbulent mixing in the Indonesian Seas and its effect on the water-mass transformation.</p>
		<h2>Period:</h2><p>February 26 – March 17, 2019 </p>
		<h2>Participants:</h2><p>Indonesia – Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) <br>
Japan – (The University of Tokyo) </p>
		<h2>Location:</h2><p>Research activities will be conducted along the cruise track between Surabaya and Bitung (excluding “Banda
Sea”). </p>

		<h2>Observations:</h2>
		<p>Vertical Microstructure Profiler eXpendable (VMP-X), Vertical Microstructure Profiler 5500
(VMP-5500), CTD, LADCP, and Shipboard ADCP. </p>
