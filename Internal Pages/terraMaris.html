		<h2>Contact point:</h2><p>Adrian Matthews (UEA) </p>
		<h2>Overview:</h2><p>The overall aim is to determine, quantify and model the atmospheric convective and atmospheric
and oceanographical dynamical processes that govern the generation of precipitation and heating
over the Maritime Continent and determine their global impacts. Specific objectives are to: (1)
Make detailed observations of the convective-dynamical atmospheric systems and their land and
ocean interactions over the Maritime Continent by taking a leading role in the international Years
of the Maritime Continent field experiment. (2) Quantify the complex interactions that govern
the diurnal cycle of precipitation and heating over the Maritime Continent, particularly the
development of the boundary layer and convection over the large islands, the generation of landsea breezes and gravity wave circulations, and the offshore convective response to those
circulations. (3) Model the convective systems in a carefully designed hierarchy of numerical
modelling experiments to transform our understanding of the Maritime Continent system, and to
understand the mechanisms behind the systematic errors in global climate models that stem from
deficiencies in their representation of the Maritime Continent. </p>

		<h2>Modelling</h2>
		<p>Hierarchy of model experiments using Met Office Unified Model (MetUM-GOML): atmospheric
model coupled to high resolution KPP mixed-layer ocean model. Cloud-resolving simulations
with ~200 m horizontal resolution, 1000 x 2000 km domain size. Convection-permitting
simulations at ~2 km resolution, 8000 x 2000 km pan-MC domain. Limited-domain
parametrized convection simulations at 15 km resolution. Global model simulations at 60 km
resolution.</p>
