		<h1>YMC-BSM-2018</h1>
		<h2>Contact point:</h2><p>Kunio Yoneyama (JAMSTEC)</p>
		<h2>Overview:</h2><p>YMC-BSM (Boreal Summer Monsoon study in) 2018 consists of three major components. The
first one is the ozone-sonde observations under the collaboration among JAMSTEC, Kyoto
University (Japan), LAPAN (Indonesia), and NHMS (Vietnam) in July 2018. The second one is
YMC-Laoag, which is a joint effort by PAGASA, University of the Philippines and JAMSTEC to
study precipitation mechanism around Laoag, northern part of Luzon Island focusing on diurnal
cycle of rain and northward propagating intraseasonal oscillation in July - August 2018. The last
one is observations at Palau Island (YMC-Palau). Those observations collect data to study boreal
summer monsoon. </p>
		<h2>Objective:</h2><p>Study on precipitation associated with boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) and
meridional circulation features associated with the monsoon. While the former will focus on the
phenomena observed in the troposphere, the latter will focus on the interaction between the lower
stratosphere and the upper troposphere. </p>
		<h2>Period:</h2><p>July 1 - August 31, 2018 </p>	
		<h2>Participants:</h2><p>Philippines - The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services
Administration (PAGASA), University of the Philippines <br>
Palau - Koror Weather Service Office <br>
Indonesia - National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) <br>
Vietnam - National Hydro-Meteorological Service (NHMS) <br>
Japan - JAMSTEC, Kyoto University </p>
